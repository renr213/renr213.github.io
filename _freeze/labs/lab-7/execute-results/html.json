Building a spam filter\n\nThe data come from incoming emails in David Diez's (one of the authors of OpenIntro textbooks) Gmail account for the first three months of 2012.\nAll personally identifiable information has been removed.\nThe dataset is called `email` and it's in the **openintro** package.\n\nThe outcome variable is `spam`, which takes the value `1` if the email is spam, `0` otherwise.\n\n## Question 1\n\na\\.\nFit a logistic regression model predicting `spam` from `exclaim_mess` (the number of exclamation points in the email message).\nThen, display the tidy output of the model.\n\nb\\.\nUsing this model and an R function like `predict()` or `augment()`, predict the probability the email is spam if it contains 10 exclamation points.\n\n## Question 2\n\na\\.\nFit another logistic regression model predicting `spam` from `exclaim_mess`, `winner` (indicating whether “winner” appeared in the email), and `urgent_subj` (whether the word \"urgent\" is in the subject of the email).\nThen, display the tidy output of the model.\n\nb\\.\nUsing this model, predict spam / not spam for all emails in the `email` dataset with `augment()`.\nStore the resulting data frame with an appropriate name.\n\nc\\.\nUsing your data frame from the previous part, determine, in a single pipeline, and using `count()`, the numbers of emails:\n\n-   that are labelled as spam that are actually spam\n-   that are not labelled as spam that are actually spam\n-   that are labelled as spam that are actually not spam\n-   that are not labelled as spam that are actually not spam\n\nStore the resulting data frame with an appropriate name.\n\nd\\.\nIn a single pipeline, and using `mutate()`, calculate the false positive and false negative rates.\nIn addition to these numbers showing in your R output, you must write a sentence that explicitly states and identified the two rates.\n\n## Question 3\n\na\\.\nFit another logistic regression model predicting `spam` from `exclaim_mess` and another variable you think would be a good predictor.\nProvide a 1-sentence justification for why you chose this variable.\nDisplay the tidy output of the model.\n\nb\\.\nUsing this model, predict spam / not spam for all emails in the `email` dataset with `augment()`.\nStore the resulting data frame with an appropriate name.\n\nc\\.\nUsing your data frame from the previous part, determine, in a single pipeline, and using `count()`, the numbers of emails:\n\n-   that are labelled as spam that are actually spam\n-   that are not labelled as spam that are actually spam\n-   that are labelled as spam that are actually not spam\n-   that are not labelled as spam that are actually not spam\n\nStore the resulting data frame with an appropriate name.\n\nd\\.\nIn a single pipeline, and using `mutate()`, calculate the false positive and false negative rates.\nIn addition to these numbers showing in your R output, you must write a sentence that explicitly states and identified the two rates.\n\ne\\.\nBased on the false positive and false negatives rates of this model, comment, in 1-2 sentences, on which model is preferable and why.\n\n# Part 2 - Hotel cancellations\n\nFor this exercise, we will work with hotel cancellations.\nThe data describe the demand of two different types of hotels.\nEach observation represents a hotel booking between July 1, 2015 and August 31, 2017.\nSome bookings were cancelled (`is_canceled = 1`) and others were kept, i.e., the guests checked into the hotel (`is_canceled = 0`).\nYou can view the code book for all variables [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).\n\nThe data can be found in the `data` folder: `hotels.csv`.\n\n## Question 4\n\nRead the data and then explore attributes of bookings and summarize your findings in 5 bullet points.\nYou must provide a visualization or summary supporting each finding.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive exploration.\nWe anticipate a wide variety of answers to this question.\n:::\n\n## Question 5\n\nUsing these data, we will try to answer the following question:\n\n> *Do we expect reservations earlier in the month or later in the month to be cancelled?*\n\n(a) **Exploration:** In a single pipeline, calculate the mean arrival date (`arrival_date_day_of_month`) for both booking that were cancelled and that were not cancelled.\n\n(b) **Justification:** In your own words, explain why we can not fit a linear model to model the relationship between if a hotel reservation was cancelled and the day of month for the booking.\n\n(c) **Model fitting and interpretation:**\n\n    -   Fit the appropriate model and display a tidy summary of the model output.\n\n    -   Interpret the slope coefficient in context of the data and the research question.\n\n(d) **Predicted:** Calculate the probability that the hotel reservation is cancelled if it the arrival date date is on the 26th of the month.\n    Based on this probability, would you predict this booking would be cancelled or not cancelled.\n    Explain your reasoning for your classification.\n\n# Part 3 - Statistics experience\n\n## Question 6\n\nYou have two options for this exercise.\nClearly indicate which option you choose.\nThen, summarize your experience in no more than 10 bullet points.\n\nInclude the following on your summary:\n\n-   Name and brief description of what you did.\n-   Something you found new, interesting, or unexpected\n-   How the talk/podcast/interview/etc. connects to something we’ve done in class.\n-   Citation or link to web page for what you watched or who you interviewed.\n\n**Option 1:** Listen to a podcast or watch a video about statistics and data science.\nThe podcast or video must be *at least 30 minutes* to count towards the statistics experience.\nA few suggestions are below:\n\n-   [posit::conf 2023 talks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9HYL-VRX0oRFZslRGHwHuwea7SvAATHp&si=95wk_4q3-mex9hhT)\n-   [rstudio::conf 2022 talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Gzxg8Pd08&list=PL9HYL-VRX0oTOwqzVtL_q5T8MNrzn0mdH)\n-   [rstudio::global 2021 talks](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/)\n-   [rstudio::conf 2020 talks](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/)\n-   [Stats + Stories Podcast](https://statsandstories.net/)\n-   [Casual Inference Podcast](https://casualinfer.libsyn.com/)\n-   [Not So Standard Deviations](https://nssdeviations.com/)\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\nYou may listen to other podcasts or watch other statistics/data science videos not included on this list.\nAsk your professor if you are unsure whether a particular podcast or video will count towards the statistics experience.\n\n**Option 2:** Talk with someone who uses statistics in their daily work.\nThis could include a professor, professional in industry, graduate student, etc.\n\n# Part 4 - Get creative\n\n## Question 7\n\nYour task is to make the following plot as ugly and as ineffective as possible.\nChange colors, axes, fonts, theme, or anything else you can think of in the code chunk below.\nYou can also search online for other themes, fonts, etc. that you want to tweak.\nTry to make it as ugly as possible, the sky is the limit!\n\nIn 2-3 sentences, explain why the plot you created is *ugly* (to you, at least) and ineffective.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  penguins, \n  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)\n  ) + \n  geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Part 5 - Harassment at work\n\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.\nHundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.\nIn addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.\nThe GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.\nAmong the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, inter-group tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.\n\nThe data for this part comes from the `gss16` data frame (containing data from the 2016 GSS) from the **dsbox** package.\n\n## Question 8\n\nIn 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.\nThe question is phrased as the following.\n\nOver the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?\n\nAnswers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our data set.\n\na.  Create a subset of the data that only contains `Yes` and `No` answers for the harassment question.\n    How many respondents chose each of these answers?\n\nb.  Describe how bootstrapping can be used to estimate the proportion of all Americans who have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.\n\nc.  Calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.\n    Use 1000 iterations when creating your bootstrap distribution.\n    Interpret this interval in context of the data.\n\n# Part 6 - Data science assessment\n\n## Question 9\n\n::: callout-important\nThis question is graded out of 10 points.\n:::\n\nTake a data science assessment at <https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bPZS3LIKoYA0fL8>.\nYour assessment will be graded out of 10 points, and those points will be added to your score for the remaining points on this lab.\nThere are no additional penalties for wrong answers, so please answer all questions.\n\nOptionally, you can participate in the research study this assessment is a part of.\nI will not find out whether you participate in the study or not, your scores will be passed on to me by the research administrator regardless of your study participation.\n",
