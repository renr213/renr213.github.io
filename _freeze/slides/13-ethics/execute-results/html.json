2021)\n\n> The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English.\n> BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size.\n> Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English.\n> In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big?\n> What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks?\n> We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::

Record](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/race.html) (Imran and Khan, 2016)\n\n> In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition.\n> Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem.\n> We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records.\n> Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes‚Äôs rule to combine the Census Bureau‚Äôs Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.\n> We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available.\n> We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%.\n> Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates.\n> We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.\n> The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.\n\n## **wru** package\n\nThe said ‚Äúsource software‚Äù is the wru package: <https://github.com/kosukeimai/wru>.\n\n::: question\nDo you have any
