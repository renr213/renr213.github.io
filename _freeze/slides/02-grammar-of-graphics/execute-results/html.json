Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.\n-   If you are really curious about Git and GitHub, let me know. But for this course, the interface between RStudio on the Posit Cloud and GitHub will be sufficient.\n:::\n\n## Tour: Git & GitHub\n\n::: demo\n**Just one option for now:**\n\nSit back and enjoy the show!\n:::\n\n# Data visualization\n\n## Examining data visualization\n\n[![Source: Twitter](images/female-heights.png)](https://twitter.com/reina_sabah/status/1291509085855260672)\n\n## What makes that a bad visualization? {.smaller}\n\n::: incremental\n-   Is the average female Latvian really 4x the height of the average female Indian?\n-   The height of the average female is presented as a two-dimensional graphic element. Height is only one dimension.\n-   What purpose to the colours serve?\n-   Plot title in in a distracting font.\n-   It looks like the average Australian, Scot, and Peruvian have exactly the same height. Correct precision of the average?\n-   Is this only for adult females?\n-   Are the data correct?\n:::\n\n## What would be better? {.smaller}\n\n## What would be better? {.smaller}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02-grammar-of-graphics_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThese data came from this [Wikipedia page](https://w.wiki/3hVH).\n\n## `ae-02-bechdel-dataviz` {.smaller}\n\n::: appex\n-   Click on the link in your email to accept the assignment.\n-   Create an new project on Posit.Cloud from your new repository\n-   Render, commit, and push your edits by the AE deadline (8:00 am January 20)\n:::\n\n## Recap of AE {.smaller}\n\n-   Construct plots with `ggplot()`.\n-   Layers of ggplots are separated by `+`s.\n-   The formula is (almost) always as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(DATA, aes(x = X-VAR, y = Y-VAR, ...)) +\n  geom_XXX()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Aesthetic attributes of a geometries (color, size, transparency, etc.) can be **map**ped to variables in the data or **set** by the user, e.g. `color = binary` vs. `color = \"pink\"`.\n-   Use `facet_wrap()` when faceting (creating small multiples) by one variable and `facet_grid()` when faceting by two variables.\n",
