Which join function should we use?\n\n    Add response here.\n\n-   **Demo:** Join the two data frames and name assign the joined data frame to a new data frame `population_continents`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** Take a look at the newly created `population_continent` data frame. There are some countries that were not in `continents`. First, identify which countries these are (they will have `NA` values for `continent`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** All of these countries are actually in the `continents` data frame, but under different names. So, let's clean that data first by updating the country names in the `population` data frame in a way they will match the `continents` data frame, and then joining them, using a `case_when()` statement in `mutate()`. At the end, check that all countries now have continent information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Think out loud:** Which continent do you think has the highest population? Which do you think has the second highest? The lowest?\n\nAdd your response here.\n\n-   **Demo:** Create a new data frame called `population_summary` that contains a row for each continent and a column for the total population for that continent, in descending order of population. Note that the function for calculating totals in R is `sum()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn:** Make a bar plot with total population on the y-axis and continent on the x-axis, where the height of each bar represents the total population in that continent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn:** Recreate the following plot, which is commonly referred to as a **lollipop plot**. Hint: Start with the points, then try adding the `segment`s, then add axis labels and `caption`, and finally, as a stretch goal, update the x scale (which will require a function we haven't introduced in lectures or labs yet!).\n\n![](https://sta199-s24.github.io/images/population-summary-lollipop.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Think out loud:** What additional improvements would you like to make to this plot.\n\nAdd your response here.\n",
