Here, we `mutate()` the `duke_forest` data frame to add a new variable called `garage` which takes the value `\"Garage\"` if the text string `\"Garage\"` is detected in the `parking` variable and takes the test string `\"No garage\"` if not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nduke_forest |>\n  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, \"Garage\"),   \"Garage\", \"No garage\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Then, facet by `garage` and use different colors for the two facets.\n-   Choose an appropriate binwidth and decide whether a legend is needed, and turn it off if not.\n-   Include informative title and axis labels.\n-   Finally, include a brief (2-3 sentence) narrative comparing the distributions of prices of Duke Forest houses that do and don't have garages. Your narrative should touch on whether having a garage \"makes a difference\" in terms of the price of the house.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd narrative here...\n\n::: callout-important\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nIt's expected that within any given marker larger houses will be priced higher.\nIt's also expected that the age of the house will have an effect on the price.\nHowever in some markets new houses might be more expensive while in others new construction might mean \"no character\" and hence be less expensive.\nSo your family friends ask: \"In Duke Forest, do houses that are bigger and more expensive tend to be newer ones than those that are smaller and cheaper?\"\n\nOnce again, data visualization skills to the rescue!\n\n-   Create a scatter plot to exploring the relationship between `price` and `area`, conditioning for `year_built`.\n-   Use `geom_smooth()` with the argument `se = FALSE` to add a smooth curve fit to the data and color the points by `year_built`.\n-   Include informative title, axis, and legend labels.\n-   Discuss each of the following claims (1-2 sentences per claim). Your discussion should touch on specific things you observe in your plot as evidence for or against the claims.\n    -   Claim 1: Larger houses are priced higher.\n    -   Claim 2: Newer houses are priced higher.\n    -   Claim 3: Bigger and more expensive houses tend to be newer ones than smaller and cheaper ones.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd narrative here...\n\n::: callout-important\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n",
